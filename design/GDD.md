## Design Principles

- **GDD is the source of truth.** PRDs follow the GDD, not the other way around.
- **Vertical slices.** Each PRD and work issue should be thin but complete end-to-end.
- **Status gates.** A section must be `Approved` before a PRD is written against it.
- **Ubiquitous language.** All terms must match `design/ubiquitous-language.md`. Run `/game-ubiquitous-language` after major additions.

## Workflow

```
Braindump / ideas
    ↓ [game-ideation agent]
design/GDD.md (this file) + design/sections/<section>.md
    ↓ [/game-ubiquitous-language]
design/ubiquitous-language.md
    ↓ [/gdd-to-prd <section>]
GitHub Issue (PRD) + prd/<feature>.md
    ↓ [/prd-to-plan <issue>]
plans/<feature>.md
    ↓ [/prd-to-issues <plan>]
GitHub Issues (work items) → crawl-craft-game repo
```
